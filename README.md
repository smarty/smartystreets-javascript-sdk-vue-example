# SmartyStreets JavaScript SDK - Vue Example

This is an example implementation of the SmartyStreets JavaScript SDK in Vue.

To spin this example up and see it in action:

1. [Sign up for a SmartyStreets account](https://smartystreets.com/pricing)
2. [Create a website key](https://account.smartystreets.com/#keys).
3. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/smartystreets/smartystreets-javascript-sdk-vue-example).
4. From your terminal, navigate into the cloned repository and install dependencies with your favorite package manager:
   - With NPM: `npm install`
   - With Yarn `yarn install` 
5. Open `src/components/Autocomplete.vue` in the cloned repository, adding [the website key you created earlier](https://account.smartystreets.com/#keys) to line `24`.
6. From the cloned repository folder on your terminal, run `npm run start`. This will open your browser and load the implementation demo.
