# Smarty JavaScript SDK - Vue Example

This is an example implementation of the Smarty JavaScript SDK in Vue.

To spin this example up and see it in action:

1. [Sign up for a Smarty account](https://www.smarty.com/pricing)
2. [Create a website key](https://www.smarty.com/account/keys).
3. [Clone this repository](https://github.com/smartystreets/smartystreets-javascript-sdk-vue-example).
4. From your terminal, navigate into the cloned repository and install dependencies with your favorite package manager:
   - With NPM: `npm install`
   - With Yarn `yarn install` 
5. Open `utils.js` in the cloned repository, adding [the website key you created earlier](https://www.smarty.com/account/keys) to line `6`.
6. From the cloned repository folder on your terminal, run `npm run start`. This will open your browser and load the implementation demo.
